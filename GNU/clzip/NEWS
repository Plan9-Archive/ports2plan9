Changes in version 1.2:

The option "-F, --recompress", which forces recompression of files whose
name already has the ".lz" or ".tlz" suffix, has been added.

Print only one status line for each multimember file when only one "-v"
is specified.

For large values of "--match-length", compression ratio has been
slightly increased and compression time has been reduced by up to 6%.
