We have an issue with gnu/as not being able to handle the APE libs asm files.

"solution": re-write all .s files to fit gnu/as
as templates, I use crt0.s and the .s files from the old ported apelibs.

setjmp.s and tas.s are copied from the original APE lib port

notes on porting:

it seems like 
			FP=%esp
			AX=%eax
			BX=%edx / %edi
			SP=%esi / %ebp ... but no logic could be found.
			
I gave up on trying to understand Assembler and try the following instead:

Cheating:

The following asm files were removed in favour of the .c files found in ../gen
	memchr.s
	  memcmp.s
	  memcpy.s
	  memmove.s
	  memset.s
	  strchr.s
	  strlen.s
	  strcat.s
	  strcpy.s
	  
The following asm files were replaced by new .c files in ../gen
	  cycles.s
	  main9.s (from src/lib9/main.c in plan9port ...hopefully the correct approximation)

remaining asm files to be fought with:
	  main9p.s
	  vlop.s
	  
	  those will be temporarily inactivated in the mkfile
