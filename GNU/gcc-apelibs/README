This is a new apelib port to GCC on Plan9
the one shipped with gnubin.tgz on /n/extra/gcc dated back to 2002-12-18
This snapshot has the last modifications from january 2012
A release diff of about 9 years.
Important reasons for the upgrade: some critical functions (like vsnprinf) were not present in the previous release.

Changes:
Include files: pragmas have been changed to gnu directories

library-specific modifications:

9/
$objtype/*.s assembly needs to be made gas-compatible
- copied from old APE lib port
setmalloctag.c: "parameter name ommitted" error fixed

ap/ : 
also copied to libc.a
local header versions to avoid:
- conflict with stdlib.h in gen/strtoll.c gen/strtoull.c
- conflict with time.h in plan9/ctime.c
- conflict with signal.h and lib.h in plan9/signal.c, sigsuspend.c
- conflict with sys/stat.h in posix/mkfifo.c
- conflict with signal.h in posix/sigset.c 
conflict with tos.h in plan9/profile.c: changed profile.c
-D__U_H to avoid u.h conflict in plan9/dir.h (9iounit.c)
- changed u.h to u2.h in qlock.c to get definitions.
plan9/sys9.h : changed so structs not only declared in parameter list.
plan9/sys9.h : comment out _WRITE for conflict in plan9/9write.c
plan9/tcgetattr.c : "parameter name ommited" error fixed.
$objtype/*.s assembly needs to be made gas-compatible
- copied from newlib (will it work?) i386
- copied from old APE lib port

bsd/ 
local header versions to avoid:
- conflict with netdb.h in gethostbyname.c gethostbyaddr.c
	getservbyaddr.c getservbyname.c
- conflict with sys/socket.h in getpeername.c getsockname.c
priv.h changed so structs are not only declared in parameter list.
socket.c : copied getsockopt and setsockopt from old APE libs gcc port.

draw/
alloc.c conflicts with system draw.h, utf.h and u.h, make local headers

libraries that built without issue:
fmt, l, net, regexp, utf, v

Scary hack:
assembly .s files failed to get processed by gnu/as
As a temporary solution, I set AS=8a in those mkfiles.
I have no idea if this is compatible...
