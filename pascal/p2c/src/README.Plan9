The initial plan was to adopt the rather readable Makefile and issue "ape/make" rather than mk in the mkfile in the top directory.

I did however decide to do a standard mk-based build...

mkmk -x proto > mkfile

The Makefile is saved for future reference or use...

as can be seen in the Makefile, basically 4 things need to be made:

libp2c.a: library for translated programs
p2c: binary that translates
p2cc: perl script for direct compilation
p2c.1 and p2cc.1 : man files.
