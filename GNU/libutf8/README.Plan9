This is a port of libutf8 to Plan9/APE

this might seem VERY backwards to port an UTF8-compatibility library to Plan9.

The purpose is however to get some _working_ wchar.h wctype.h functionality.

The Heirloom libwchar headers "promise too much" declairing functionality not present in the library.

GREP=grep CFLAGS="-D_POSIX_SOURCE -D_SUSV2_SOURCE -D_BSD_EXTENSION -D_LIMITS_EXTENSION -D_RESEARCH_SOURCE -D_C99_SNPRINTF_EXTENSION" configure --libdir=/$objtype/lib/ape --includedir=/sys/include/ape --datadir=/sys --with-traditional-mbstowcs --disable-shared --enable-static

post-packaging changes:Â¨
correct directory structure.

add #pragma lib "/$M/lib/ape/libutf8.a" to 

wchar.h and wctype.h: make wrapper headers pointing to utf8/
include pragma.

for legacy support (old headers pointing to libwchar.a), copy libutf8.a to libwchar.a.
