This is an attempted port of Netsurf's HTML5 C library to Plan9

The library is built against libparserutils, (apr) iconv and json-c as instructed in README.
perl was used to generate an .inc file.

files in sub-directories under src/ have been moved down to a single directory (because this is easier to handle wiht simple mkfiles).

The top mkfile generated by:

mkmk -x build -x docs -x examples -x include -x perf -x test > mkfile
