	* Version 1.2 released.
	* main.c: Added new option `-F, --recompress'.
	* main.c (decompress): Print only one status line for each
	  multimember file when only one `-v' is specified.
	* encoder.h (Lee_update_prices): Update high length symbol prices
	  independently of the value of `pos_state'. This gives better
	  compression for large values of `--match-length' without being
	  slower.
	* encoder.h encoder.c: Optimize pair price calculations. This
	  reduces compression time for large values of `--match-length'
	  by up to 6%.

	* Version 1.1 released.
	* Code has been converted to `C89 + long long' from C99.
	* main.c: Fixed warning about fchown return value being ignored.
	* decoder.c: `-tvvvv' now shows compression ratio.
	* main.c: Match length limit set by options -1 to -8 has been
	  reduced to extend range of use towards gzip. Lower numbers now
	  compress less but faster. (-1 now takes 43% less time for only
	  20% larger compressed size).
	* encoder.c: Compression of option -9 has been slightly increased.
	* main.c (open_instream): Do not show the message
	  " and `--stdout' was not specified" for directories, etc.
	* New examples have been added to the manual.
