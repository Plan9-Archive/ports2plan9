Old openssl port does not come with #pragma lib declarations in headers, so -lcrypto and -lopenssl need to be declared explicitly. However, also after explicit linking, some stuff are missing if libssh2 or libmetalink is used. We need a new openssl port.

For libmetalink, it depends on libexpat, but to ensure that it is linked in (if not pulled in by pragmas in headers) it is also explicitly declared.

libcurl.a8 can be changed to libcurl.a$O to get an arch-independent mkfile.
